## 🎯 Solution: Finalize Localization

### Step 1: Open Localization Details
1. On the subscription page, find the **"Localization"** section
2. Click on **"English (U.S.)"** (the clickable link in the table)

### Step 2: Review and Verify Fields
You should see a form with:
- **Display Name:** `MLetras Pro`
- **Description:** `Unlimited folders, notes, auto-scroll, and dark mode`

**Verify:**
- ✅ Both fields are filled (not empty)
- ✅ Display Name matches what you want users to see
- ✅ Description is complete and accurate

### Step 3: Check for Missing Fields
Look for any additional fields that might be required:
- **Promotional Text** (optional but sometimes causes issues if empty)
- **Keywords** (if present)
- Any other text fields

### Step 4: Save the Localization
1. If you made any changes, click **"Save"** at the bottom
2. If no changes were needed, try clicking **"Save"** anyway (sometimes this finalizes it)

### Step 5: Return to Main Subscription Page
1. Click the back button or breadcrumb to return to the main subscription page
2. Click **"Save"** on the main subscription page (top right)
3. Wait a few seconds for App Store Connect to process

6. Click **"Save"**

### Option B: Delete and Re-add (if edit doesn't work)
1. In the Localization table, find **"English (U.S.)"**
2. Look for a delete/remove option (usually a "-" button or trash icon)
3. Delete the localization
4. Click the **"+"** button next to "Localization"
5. Select **"English (U.S.)"**
6. Enter:
   - **Display Name:** `MLetras Pro`

## 📝 Recommended Description Text

Your current description is:
```
Unlimited folders, notes, auto-scroll, and dark mode
```

Consider using this more complete version (matches your review notes):
```
Unlimited folders, unlimited notes, auto-scroll lyrics, dark theme, and priority support. Cancel anytime.
```

**Why:** More descriptive and matches what's in your review notes. Also includes "Cancel anytime" which is good practice.

## ✅ Expected Result

After fixing the localization:
1. Status should change from **"Prepare for Submission"** to **"Complete"** or **"Ready"**
2. Main subscription status should change from **"Missing Metadata"** to **"Ready to Submit"**

---

## 🚨 If Status Still Shows "Missing Metadata"

If after fixing localization the status is still "Missing Metadata":

1. **Check the main subscription page for red error messages**
2. **Look for any other sections with warnings** (yellow dots/icons)
3. **Try expanding "Subscription Prices"** section to ensure it's fully saved
4. **Wait 2-3 minutes** - App Store Connect can take time to update status
5. **Refresh the page** and check again

## 🔍 Other Potential Issues

If localization fix doesn't resolve it, check:

1. **Subscription Information Tab** (if separate from Localization)
   - Some App Store Connect interfaces have a separate "Subscription Information" tab
   - Ensure Display Name and Description are filled there too

2. **Image Status**
   - Your image shows "Prepare for Submission" 
   - This usually doesn't block, but verify it's uploaded correctly

3. **Review Information**
   - Verify screenshot is uploaded
   - Review notes are filled (you have this ✅)

**Most likely fix: Click into the English (U.S.) localization, verify fields, and click Save!** 🎯
